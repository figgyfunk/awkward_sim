Jamie; Ugh... what is this shit... I feel like ass. I... probably drank juuuuust a bit too much. But I had sooooo much fun, too, so why'd the fun have to end with me in this sorry state ._.
Mom; Jamie, get your butt down here! Grandma's over to visit!
Jamie; God damni- Okay, coming! ACTIVATE
Jamie; 'Sup, Grams?
Mom; Jamie, that is not how you address your grandmother! 
Grandma; Why, hello there sweet Jamie. My, you don't look well. Are you okay? Did you recently come down with a fever?
Player;Yeah, something like that, I guess.:line,7$ !,0:!,0:!,0:>=,-1:!,0:!,0/0,0,0,-2,0,1; I totally went bender last night Grams, let me tell you.

Grandma; I'm sorry to hear that, dear. Would you be up to go to breakfast?
Player;Hell yeah, let's go! Mind if we drive through McDonalds?:line,13$ !,0:!,0:!,0:!,0:!,0:!,0/0,0,0,0,-2,3; Nah, not really.

Mom; Jamie!
Grandma; Dear, it's alright. I may have just drove these four hours for nothing. END
Grandma; I did drive four hours to come see you, Jamie. What do you say we spend some time together?
Player;Sucks to suck, Grams.:line,26$ !,0:!,0:<=,-4:!,0:!,0:!,0/0,0,-2,0,0,-3; I suppose I can...:line,19$ !,0:!,0:!,0:!,0:!,0:!,0/0,-2,0,0,0,1; OH MY-blaaaaaargh... I...

Jamie; I don't feel so good, Grams...
Mom; ...
Jamie; (Shit! I'm so dumb.)
Jamie; BLAAARGHERSBLAAAAAGH *cough* cough*
Grandma; Lord Jamie MY DEAR SWEET GRANDCHILD ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

Grandma; Thank you, Jamie. I'll drive, so let's be on our way. I'll treat you to whatever your little stomach desires.
Jamie; Hah, you might regret that. My stomach can take on the world! Hope you're ready~
Grandma; Nuturing her grandchild is a grandmother's duty, so don't you worry your little head about it.
Jamie; Grams, my head isn't small either ._.
Mom; Have fun you two!
Jamie; Ugh, okay, Mom. Let's get moving, Grams. END
Mom; Jamie, do you understand what you're saying?!
Grandma; My daughter, it's alright. I suppose it can't be helped. Old Grams over here is just going to have to pray to the higher powers that I can live long enough to see you again... 
Mom; Mom...
Jamie; ... END
Grandma; Jamie, why? And, my daughter, I thought you had it in you to raise your child better than this. I'm VERY disappointed in both of you.
Mom; Huh? What kind of nonsense is that? Jamie's choices are Jamie's alone. Isn't that right?
Player;Now, now, Mom. Grams. It was a joke. Lighten up a little~:line,7$ >=,5:!,0:!,0:!,0:!,0:!,0/1,0,0,0,0,3; Yeah, you're right. Blazin it 420, smashin that beer, my life's like that.

Grandma; Well now I'm upset. How did you-no, why must you be this way, Jamie? Forget breakfast, I'll need to have my daughter teach you some basic behavior skills. I'll be using the four hour drive to think about how I went astray as both a mother and as a grandmother... END
Grandma; And this is why I keep telling you all, video games rot brains! My daughter, stop letting Jamie indulge in these rudimentary playthings!
Mom; Well, uh...
Jamie; Grams, c'mon, you've got to understand you're overreacting...
Grandma; So I'm overreacting to caring about my grandchild's health? You know what could be a good remedy, besides getting rid of your games?
Jamie; I'm not giving up games, thank you very much. Anyway, it's been a while, Grams.
Grandma; I... it is indeed true it has been some time. But, my dear grandchild, you look so very pale, maybe a step outside will do you some good. I only care for your well-being. What do you say?
Player;Sorry Grams...I'm not in the best state of mind, just a little sick:line,7$ !,0:!,0:!,0:!,0:!,0:!,0/1,0,0,0,0,1;Excuuuuse me, but you look like old shit, Grams, Don't give me that:line,9$ !,0:!,0:<=,-8:!,0:!,0:!,0/0,0,0,-3,0,-3;I guess I'll come clean. I kind of did some illegal shit last night.:line,11$ !,0:>=,-1:!,0:!,0:!,0:!,0/1,0,0,0,0,-2;Y'know, Grams, maybe you're right. I should stay inside.:line,11$ !,0:!,0:!,0:!,0:!,0:!,0/0,0,0,-2,0,-1
